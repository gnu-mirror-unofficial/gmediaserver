<h1>GMediaServer - Introduction</h1>
<p>GMediaServer is a UPnP music media server. It implements the server component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available audio files. GMediaServer uses the built-in http server of libupnp to stream the audio files to clients.</p>
<p>The following media devices have been tested and are confirmed to work with GMediaServer:</p>
<div class="block">
<a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/details/MP101.php">Netgear MP101</a><br>
</div>
<p>Other UPnP media devices (including software based) may work as well - see below for a more detailed list of supported devices. For a quick start, see the Usage and Known Bugs sections below.</p>
<p>GMediaServer is written in C by <a href="mailto:oskar@osk.mine.nu">Oskar Liljeblad</a>. It should compile and run on any modern POSIX compatible system such as Linux. GMediaServer is a console based application which is usually run in the background.</p>
<p>GMediaServer is free software - it is licensed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL).</p>
<p>This project is in an early stage of development. Many essential features are planned for the future. With your help, we will make a media server that can compete with the proprietary (and Windows-only) servers bundled with media device hardware.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<p>2005-07-04: GMediaServer 0.4.0 released.</p>
<div class="block">
Added Linksys WMLS11B to Supported Devices.<br>
Added Philips Streamium SL300i to Supported Devices.<br>
Applied patch from Ivo Clarysse adding support for serving schema files through the UPnP internal web server. GMediaServer now works with Philips RC9800i (and probably others) thanks to this patch.<br>
Added note about 1.3.7 firmware requirement for the MP101.<br>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>The following programs are required to build GMediaServer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GNU C Compiler (gcc), 2.95 or later.</p>
<p>GMediaServer uses some features specific to gcc 2.95, such as macros with variable number of arguments. The GNU C Compiler is part of the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU Compiler Collection</a> which can be downloaded from <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>. In Debian and many other distributions the package is called <code>gcc</code>.</p>
</ul>
<p>The following libraries are required to build and run GMediaServer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linux SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp), 1.2.1 or later</p>
<p>The libupnp library is used to communicate using the UPnP protocol. libupnp can be downloaded from http://upnp.sourceforge.net/.</p>
<p>Debian packages for libupnp are currently available in testing (and unstable). The runtime package is called <code>libupnp0</code>, and the package required when building <code>libupnp-dev</code>. Packages for stable (woody) can be downloaded from <a href="http://detroit.ddo.jp/debian/woody/">http://detroit.ddo.jp/debian/woody/</a>. The runtime package is called <code>libupnp1</code>, and the development package <code>libupnp1-dev</code>.</p>
</ul>
<p>The following libraries are optional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ID3v1/ID3v2 Tagging Library (id3lib), 3.8 or later</p>
<p>This library allows GMediaServer to retrieve ID3 information from MP3 files. id3lib can be downloaded from <a href="http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/">http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>
<p>The Debian package for id3lib is currently available in testing (and unstable) and is called <code>libid3-3.8.3</code>. <code>libid3-3.8.3-dev</code> is required when building. The version available in stable (woody) - 3.7.13 - is too old. However, there are numerous sites providing backports of 3.8 and later to stable. One such site is <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/clam/download/debian/woody/">http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/clam/download/debian/woody/</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h1>Building and Installation</h1>
<p>Compile GMediaServer by running <code>configure</code> and then <code>make</code>. This should produce an executable <code>gmediaserver</code> in the <code>src</code> subdirectory, which can be used right away. No extra files need to be installed.</p>
<p>If you want to install GMediaServer on your system, run <code>make install</code>. This will copy the executable into the appropriate directory (<code>/usr/local/bin</code> by default).</p>
<p>For more information regarding <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code>, see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.57/html_node/autoconf_139.html">INSTALL</a> document.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>GMediaServer runs from the console only. It supports the usual <code>--help</code> option which displays usage and option information. GMediaServer expects a directory argument, specifying where audio files are stored. You should probably also use the <code>-i</code> (<code>--interface</code>) option to specify which interface GMediaServer should listen on. The first times you run GMediaServer it would also be a good idea to increase the verbosity. Example:</p>
<div class="block">
<pre>
./gmediaserver -ieth1 -v4 /audio
</pre>
</div>
<p>At the moment, there is no manual page for GMediaServer.</p>
<h1>Supported Devices</h1>
<p>The following media devices have been tested and are confirmed to work with GMediaServer:</p>
<ul>

<p>URL: <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/details/MP101.php">http://www.netgear.com/products/details/MP101.php</a></p>
<p>Notes: You probably need to upgrade the firmware to 1.3.7 or later to use GMediaServer with the MP101.</p>
<li><p>Linksys Wireless-B Music System (WMLS11B)</p>
<p>URL: <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=38&prid=631">http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=38&prid=631</a></p>

<h1>Known bugs and limitations</h1>
<p>Unfortunately the Netgear MP101 is quite buggy, even with the latest firmware (1.3.7 as of writing this). Numerous forum posts on the internet can confirm this. For me, it seems to hang randomly when browsing or when just about to play a song. I have yet to discover what is causing this.</p>
<p>If you need to listen on more than one interface, you will have to start multiple instances of the media server.</p>
<p>GMediaServer keeps information on all audio files in memory. If your audio collection is huge, this might be a problem.</p>
<p>As GMediaServer is in an early stage of development, many essential features are unimplemented.</p>
